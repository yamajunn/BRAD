The dataset includes 5220 images.
Tree are annotated in COCO for MMDetection format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise
* Random shear of between -12째 to +12째 horizontally and -15째 to +15째 vertically
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 1.97 percent of pixels
